In your home directory you will find some text files. Perform the following actions on these
### Task 
First, look for `reversed.txt`. The text inside makes no sense when you read from top to bottom.     
But there is a command that lets you read a file **backwards**, from **bottom to top**.   
Use that command to display this file and redirect the reversed output to `/opt/corrected.txt`

### Solution
```bash
tac /home/bob/reversed.txt > /opt/corrected.txt
```

## 2
### Look for a file called `shuffled.txt`. You will find `200` lines Inside it, in a random order. Do not change the contents of this file throughout this exercise. There are lines that contain the word line followed by a number between `00` and `99`, and some lines that contain the word `LINE` followed by a number between `00` and `99`.    

Filter out only the lines written in **CAPITAL LETTERS**, containing the word `LINE`. Then sort this filtered output so that these lines appear in their natural order, from **LINE00, LINE01, LINE02, all the way to LINE99**.   
Save this filtered and sorted output to this file: `/opt/sortedLINES.txt `


### Solution
```bash
grep 'LINE[0-9][0-9]' /home/bob/shuffled.txt | sort > /opt/sortedLINES.txt
```

### Task 
 Archive the databases directory again. But this time, do it differently. First of all, save the archive at /opt/archive2.tar.gz.
This time the tar tf /opt/archive2.tar.gz command should show bob/databases/ as the base directory instead of home/bob/databases/. Here's an example :

### Solution
```bash
$ cd /home
$ sudo tar -czf /opt/archive2.tar.gz bob/databases

# check list
$ tar tf /opt/archive2.tar.gz
bob/databases/file85
bob/databases/file86
bob/databases/file87
bob/databases/file88
bob/databases/file89
bob/databases/file90
bob/databases/file91
bob/databases/file92
bob/databases/file93
bob/databases/file94
```

### Task 
What is the SELinux security context for the process running with PID 2? Write this context to the `/opt/context.txt` file. Here is an example:say a user found this when inspecting SELinux aspects of PID 848:

### Solution
```bash
$ ps -eZ | grep 2 
system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0       2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
or 
$ ps -Z -p 2 

$ echo 'system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0' > /opt/context.txt
```

Save the name of this user to the /opt/user.txt file.

### Solution
```bash
$ sudo grep 'password changed' /var/log/messages | tail -n 1 
/var/log/secure:Feb 26 14:13:11 centos-host sudo[64406]:     bob : TTY=pts/1 ; PWD=/home/bob ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/grep -r password change /var/log
$ echo 'root' > /opt/user.txt
```

### Task 
Setup the following three cron jobs for root user:

A. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin/script1.sh` runs every Monday at 4AM

B. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin/script2.sh` runs every first day of the month at 04:30 AM

C. Make sure that `/usr/local/bin/script3.sh` runs every day at 1AM, 2AM and 3AM. For script3.sh make sure to create a single cron job, not three separate ones for each hour.



### Solution
```bash
# if you target user bob, then run -u bob
$ sudo crontab -e
# add the following lines
# m h dom mon dow command
0 4 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/script1.sh

## 8
### Task 
**Create a new user** called `jane` and then perform the following actions:
A. Set her password to `examPassed`
B. Make sure that she can run **sudo** commands.


C. Set her account to **expire** on `2028-12-10`. This is `account expiration`  
**not** to be confused with password **expiration**, or **password locking**, which are different things.

D. There is an another user called `david`. Mark the password for **david as expired**.   
This will effectively force him to change his password next time he logs in.


### Solution
```bash
$ sudo useradd jane
$ sudo passwd jane
examPassed
# check all  sudo groups 
$ cat /etc/sudoers 
# Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
$ sudo usermod -aG wheel jane

# or 
$ sudo usermod -aG sudo jane
# or without password
$ sudo visudo
# add the following line
jane ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL


$ sudo chage -E 2028-12-10 jane
# or 
$ sudo usermod -e 2028-12-10 jane

$ sudo chage -d 0 david
# or 
$ sudo passwd -e david

```

## 9
### Task 
Currently, when you use the `su` command it will **ask for root's password** to allow you to log in as user root.    
Modify the `PAM` configuration for the `su` command so that you **no longer have to type that password**.  
More specifically, modify the `PAM` config for `su` so that users in the `wheel` group are **not required to type** that, because they're implicitly `trusted`.

### Solution
Edit `/etc/pam.d/su` file:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/pam.d/su
```

Uncomment below given line:  
```
#auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
```

so, it should look like
```
auth           sufficient      pam_wheel.so trust use_uid
```

Finally save the changes.

### Task 
#### A bind DNS server is installed on this system. Find the DNS zone file for the `example.com` domain and open it for editing.

A. An inexperienced sysadmin added two lines but made a small mistake that made those lines invalid.   
Due to that the named service is not coming up now. Can you spot and correct those two lines? Also make sure to start named service after that.

B. Add a new nameserver called `ns3.example.com`. This nameserver should have the following IP address: `10.11.12.11`

C. After you've made your modifications, don't forget to **increment the serial number** (0 to 1).

### Solution
Try to start named service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start named
```

Now check its status:
```bash
sudo systemctl status named
```


You should see issue related to **CNAME** and **TXT** record which are having typos,   
fix the same in `/var/named/example.com.zone` and start named service:


sudo vi `/var/named/example.com.zone`
```
Change www             CNAM   example.com. to www             CNAME   example.com.
```

and

```
Change example.com.    TX     "We can write anything in here!" to example.com.    TXT     "We can write anything in here!"
```
```bash
sudo systemctl start named

```

Edit `/var/named/example.com.zone` file to add a new NS (you can add under `ns2.example.com`.):

```bash
sudo vi /var/named/example.com.zone
```


The entry should be like:

```
@               NS      ns1.example.com.
@               NS      ns2.example.com.
@               NS      ns3.example.com.
ns1             A       10.11.12.9
ns2             A       10.11.12.10
ns3             A       10.11.12.11
```
Also increment the serial number from **0 to 1**
Restart named service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart named
```

## 11
### Task 
Change the disk quota for the group called `nginx`. Limit the **inodes** that this group can create.  
Set a **soft limit** of `3500` inodes and a **hard limit** of `4000` inodes on `/mnt` partition.

### Solution

```bash
findmnt -n -o SOURCE /mnt
/dev/vdb1
```

Set quota for group nginx:
```bash
sudo edquota -g nginx 
```

For `/dev/vdb1` under inodes set values for soft and hard

It should be something like:

```
Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard
 /dev/vdb1                     0            0          0          0      3500     4000
```

## 12
### Task 

Make sure you're logged in as the user called `bob` and you perform this task using user `bob` only (without sudo).   
If you're currently logged in as `root`, exit from this user session and return to your main user session under bob.


A. Find all directories in the `/home/bob/library/` directory. This means files should not appear in the result list.   
Narrow your search to directories only. Some directories are unreadable and will **show up as errors (stderr)** in this result list.   
In your find command, **redirect all error messages** to this file `/home/bob/errors.out`.


B. Now, **redirect all standard messages** (non-errors, stdout) to `/home/bob/standard.out`


C. Perform the same search as above, but this time, **redirect BOTH error messages and standard messages (stdout,stderr)**   
to the same file: `/home/bob/all.out` Basically, what you would see in your terminal if you would use the find command normally (without any redirects) is the exact content you should have in `/home/bob/all.out`, with results, errors and standard output, appearing in the same order. 


### Solution
Save all errors:

```bash
find library/ -type d 2> errors.out
```
Save stdout:
```bash
find library/ -type d > standard.out
```
Save both stderr and stdout:

```bash
find library/ -type d > all.out  2>&1
```
