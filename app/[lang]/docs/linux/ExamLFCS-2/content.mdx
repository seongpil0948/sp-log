## Essetial Command - 1
### Task 

In your home directory you will find a directory called `collection`. Take the following steps:

A. `Copy` this `entire "collection" directory` to the `/opt/` directory. But make sure to `preserve` `all permission and ownership` information about the files it contains. Hint: consult the manual for the copying command and look for the `archive` option. Use that to preserve all permission/ownership info.


B. With your copy safely in place, you can now remove this entire `collection` directory from your home directory


C. Finally, create a new directory called collection2 in your `/opt/ `directory.


### Solution
First switch to root user:
```bash
sudo su - root
```
Execute below given command to copy entire collection directory to /opt directory:

```bash
cp -rp /home/bob/collection /opt/collection
```

Execute below given command to remove collection directory:
```bash
rm -rf /home/bob/collection
```
Execute below given command to create collection2 directory:

```bash
mkdir /opt/collection2
```

## Essetial Command - 2
### Task 

There is a directory called `/opt/databases/`. This should **belong to** your user, called `bob`. But someone entered the wrong commands and messed up the permissions and ownership information. Correct these in the following way:

A. Change the user `owner and group owner` for this directory. `/opt/databases/` should be owned by the `user` called `bob` and the `group` also called `bob`.   
Make sure to make this a recursive change, so that ownership is changed for the directory itself along with the `files/`directories it contains.



B. The permissions for `/opt/databases/` directory are **777** currently, which are way **too open**.Anyone can read and write to this directory.   
Change these permissions so that only the user called `bob` can **read**, **write** and **execute** within `/opt/databases/` directory.   
Permissions for the `group` and for others should be **all denied**. These permissions should **only** be applied to the **directory itself**, not to the **files/directories** inside.


C. Change permissions for **all files** inside the `/opt/databases/` directory (`file1`, `file2`, `file3`).   
The **user bob** should have permissions to **read** and **write** to these files, but not to execute them.  
The **group** should have **read only** permissions on these files, nothing else.  
**others** should not have **any permissions** at all (all denied).



### Solution

Execute below given command to change the user and group ownership for the databases directory:
```bash
chown -R bob:bob /opt/databases
```
Execute below given command to update the permissions for databases directory:
```bash
chmod 0700 /opt/databases
```
Execute below given command to change permissions for all the files under databases directory:
```bash
chmod 0640 /opt/databases/*
```

file `/opt/services.txt` and perform the following tasks:  
replace all occurrences of the word `SSH` with `NULL` in this file.

```bash
sed -i 's/SSH/NULL/g' /opt/services.txt
```
- `-i` : This option is used to edit the file in place. It means it will replace the original file with the updated file.  
- `s` : This option is used to substitute the string.
- `g` : This option is used to replace all occurrences of the string in the file.

Task 2: 파일에서 특정 패턴을 찾아 삭제하기
sed를 사용하여 파일에서 특정 패턴을 찾아 삭제할 수도 있습니다. 이 작업은 /pattern/d 형식의 sed 명령어를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다.

### filename 파일에서 'foo'라는 패턴을 찾아 해당 라인을 삭제합니다.
```bash
sed '/foo/d' filename
```

### 파일에서 특정 라인을 출력하기
sed를 사용하여 파일에서 특정 라인을 출력할 수 있습니다. 이 작업은 n,p 형식의 sed 명령어를 사용하여 수행할 수 있습니다.

이 명령어는 filename 파일에서 5번째 라인을 출력합니다.
```bash
sed -n '5,p' filename
```
5 ~ 10 라인까지 출력
```bash
sed -n '5,10p' filename
```

```bash
sed -e '/^$/d' -e '/foo/d' -e '/bar/d' filename $filename
```
위 명령어는 filename 파일에서 **빈 줄**, `/foo`, `/bar` 을 삭제합니다.
- `-e` : 이 옵션은 sed 명령어를 여러 개 사용할 때 사용합니다.

```bash
sed -n -e '5p' -e '10p' filename
```
이 명령어는 filename 파일에서 5번째 라인과 10번째 라인을 출력합니다.

```bash
sed -e 's/foo/bar/' -e 's/baz/qux/' filename
```
이 명령어는 filename 파일에서 'foo'를 'bar'로, 'baz'를 'qux'로 바꿉니다.

## 9
### Task 

Inspect the `httpd` service and figure out its **unit file**.   
Further, find out the **SELinux label** that it has.   
Save this label to this file: `/opt/label.txt`


For example, the SELinux label for `/bin/sudo` shows up like this `system_u:object_r:sudo_exec_t:s0` `/usr/bin/sudo`    
In that case,  you would write `system_u:object_r:sudo_exec_t:s0` to that file, skipping the `/usr/bin/sudo` part.


### Solution
Execute below given command to find out the unit file:

```bash
systemctl status httpd
```
You will find the unit file besides loaded parameter, execute below given command to find out the SELinux label:

```bash
ls -Z /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service
```

Save the required value in /opt/label.txt file:
```bash
sudo vi /opt/label.txt
```

The file content would be something like:

```bash
system_u:object_r:httpd_unit_file_t:s0
```

## 15
### Task 


We have `/dev/vdb` disk on this system. Perform the following actions on it.

A. **Create** a partition `/dev/vdb1` of `400MB` in size and **format it as xfs** file system.  
Edit the correct file in `/etc/` so that `/dev/vdb1` is **automatically mounted into the /backups** directory every time the system boots up.   
Default mount options should be used.


B. Create a partition `/dev/vdb2` of `100MB` in size, **format it as ext4** file system and mount it in `/mnt/` .   
We want to keep some sensitive data on **ext4** filesystem and we want to make sure that it's **not modified**.   
To solve this problem, mount `/dev/vdb2` into the `/mnt` directory using **read-only** mount option.   
It does not matter what the other mount options are. Just make sure this mount point is read-only so that users cannot change contents on this filesystem.


C. Create a partition `/dev/vdb3` of `450MB` in size and **format it with the xfs** filesystem.   
To make this easier to spot in the future, among the other filesystems, **set the filesystem label** to `ExamFS` when you format it.   
Make sure that the label is exactly ExamFS and **not examfs** or anything that has different letters in UPPERCASE or lowercase.   
We will make use of this `/dev/vdb3` partition in the upcoming questions so create it before moving to the next question.

### Solution
Switch to the root user:
```bash
sudo su - 
```

먼저 파티션을 만든다.

### Task 

**Edit the disk quota** for the user called `bob`.   
**Limit** the amount of **storage** space he can use (**not inodes**).   
Set a **soft** limit of `100MB` and a **hard** limit of `500MB` on `/mydata` partition.


### Solution
Execute below given command:
```bash
$ sudo xfs_quota -x -c 'limit bsoft=100m bhard=500m bob' /mydata/
# or
$ sudo edquota -u bob
Disk quotas for user starrykss (uid 500):   Filesystem         blocks         soft        hard        inodes      soft    hard    /dev/sda1           1200            0           0           166         0       0
```
• Filesystem : Quota가 설정되어 있는 파티션
• blocks : 현재 사용 중인 용량 (KB)
• soft
  • 보통의 경우 사용자가 사용할 수 있는 최대 용량 (KB)
  • 여기에 지정한 용량이 hard에 지정한 값보다 작게 설정하였다면, hard 용량 까지는 지정한 유예 기간(Grace Period) 동안은 초과할 수 있음.
  • 유예 기간 내에 soft에 지정한 용량 이하로 줄이지 않으면 파일 생성이 불가능함.
• hard
  • 실제 사용자가 최대로 사용할 수 있는 용량 (KB)
  • soft 는 초과하여 사용 가능하나, hard에 설정한 용량은 절대 초과할 수 없음.

• inodes : 현재 사용 중인 I-node 수(파일이나 디렉터리의 개수)를 나타냄.
• soft

• 일반적으로 사용자에게 지정하는 inode 값
• 파일이나 디렉터리를 생성할 수 있는 개수
• 유예 기간 적용 등은 blocks 항목과 같음.

• hard

• 절대 초과할 수 없는 inode 값
• 사용자가 생성할 수 있는 파일이나 디렉터리의 값
