### Task 
In your home directory you will find a directory called collection. Perform the following tasks:
A. **Find the file(s)** that are exactly `1 byte` in size. **Move these files** to the `/opt/foundfiles/` directory.  

B. All of the remaining files in `collection/` have some text content inside.   
Look through these all files and find the files that **contain the letter** `e or E`.   
For example, a file with the word `help or HELP` should match. Once you found these files, also **move them** to `/opt/foundfiles/` directory.  

C. **Find the file** that is **not readable by other users**, rest of permissions don't matter.   
Once you found this, **restore** the `+r` permission for **other users**.   
Make this single change, **leaving all other permission unchanged**, in their original form.

### Solution
A
```bash
$ find /home/bob/collection -type f -size 1c -exec mv {} /opt/foundfiles/ \;
``` 
B
```bash
$ find /home/bob/collection -type f -exec grep -l -i 'e' {} \; -exec mv {} /opt/foundfiles/ \;
```
C
```bash
$ find /home/bob/collection -type f ! -perm -o=r -exec chmod o+r {} \;
```

### Task 
In your home directory you will find two directories, `dir1` and `dir2`. They are almost identical, containing the same filenames.  
A. There is **one unique file** in one of the directories, **remove this file** so that the directories **become truly identical**.  
B. Edit `dir1/file007` file and add this text inside: `This file has been edited`

### Solution

A
```bash
$ diff -rq /home/bob/dir1 /home/bob/dir2
$ rm /home/bob/dir2/file387
```
- `-r`: 재귀적으로 디렉토리를 비교합니다.
- `-q`: 파일이 다른 경우에만 파일 이름을 출력합니다.

B
```bash
$ echo "This file has been edited" >> /home/bob/dir1/file007
```

### Task 

A. Find out what **DNS resolver(s)** this system is using, **save the IP address** of at least one of the DNS resolvers to the following file: `/opt/resolverandroutes.txt`  

B. **Print out the routing table** of this system and save the output to the same file: `/opt/resolverandroutes.txt` Make sure you **don't overwrite** the previous file contents.

C. **Add a static host** to this system. The hostname you should add is `webserver` and it should statically resolve to the following IP address: `1.1.1.1`

### Solution
A
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf  | grep 'nameserver' | awk '{print $2}' > /opt/resolverandroutes.txt
```
B 
```bash
$ ip route >> /opt/resolverandroutes.txt
```
C
```bash
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts
# Add the following line to the file
webserver 1.1.1.1
```

### Task 

You have a disk available at `/dev/vdb`.
A. Create a `500MB` partition on this disk.
B. Create an `ext4` filesystem with a block size of `2048 bytes` on this partition.
C. Manually mount this filesystem in the `/mnt` directory.

### Solution

Follow below given steps:
```bash
fdisk /dev/vdb
```
Now enter below given responses:
```
Command (m for help): n
Select (default p): [just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter]
Partition number (1-4, default 1): [just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter]
First sector (2048-2097151, default 2048):  [just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter]
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-2097151, default 2097151): +500M
Command (m for help): w
```

Further create an `ext4` filesystem with a **block size** of `2048 bytes` on this partition:
```bash
mkfs.ext4 -b 2048 /dev/vdb1
```
- `-b`: Specify the size of blocks in bytes  

Mount this filesystem in the `/mnt` directory:  
```bash
mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/
```
Verify the mount point:  
```bash
$ findmnt
/mnt                                /dev/vdb1   ext4        rw,relatime,seclabel
```
