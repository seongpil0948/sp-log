## 팁
- 시스템이 실행할 스크립트를 작성하라 하면, `chmod +x [file]` 하셈 ㅋㅋㅋ 하
- crontab 1-3 지원하는 걸로 아는데 걍 1,2,3 하셈
- `sudo su root` 하면 루트로 바로 들어갈 수 있음
- gateway ip 는 ip addr 의 default 말고, `ip r | grep default` 로 찾으셈

### Task
User user2 should be able to execute sudo bash /root/dangerous.sh without having to enter the root password

### Solution
You can use `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.
```bash
sudo visudo
```
Add below given line at the end of the
```
user2 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash /root/dangerous.sh
```

## Text Manipulation and Regular Expressions - 1
### Task 
In this exercise, you'll need to make some changes to the `/etc/settings.cfg` file.

A. Add a new line at the end of this file. The line should have this content: `system51=reserved` . Save the file and exit the editor.


B. Use the correct command to display only the systems that are `disabled` in this file. The command should output something like:
```
system1=disabled
system4=disabled
```
and so on.
Now redirect this filtered output to this file: `/opt/disabledsystems.txt`
C. Use the correct tool to automate a search and replace action on the /etc/settings.cfg file. All of the words enabled should be changed to the word disabled.


### Solution
You should use commands like `vi, sed, grep` and `redirection` to accomplish these tasks.
Switch into the root user:
```bash
sudo su - 
```

Edit `/etc/settings.cfg` file to add the required content:

```bash
vi /etc/settings.cfg
```

Go to the bottom of the file by pressing SHIFT+g. Then add the given line in the bottom of the file:
```
system51=reserved
```

Now display only the systems that are disabled in this file and redirect the output to `/opt/disabledsystems.txt` file.
```bash
grep disabled /etc/settings.cfg > /opt/disabledsystems.txt
```
Change all words enabled to the word disabled.
```bash
sed -i "s/enabled/disabled/g" /etc/settings.cfg
```

## Storage Management - 1

### Task
In this exercise you'll prepare the disk found at` /dev/vdb` to be used by this system.

A. First, you'll see that this disk has `1GB` of unpartitioned space. 
Create two partitions. Each should be exactly `500MB` in size.


B. Format the first partition, `/dev/vdb1` to be used as swap and enable it.


C. Edit the correct file in `/etc/` so that `/dev/vdb1` is automatically mounted as `swap` space every time the system boots up.


D. Format the second partition at `/dev/vdb2` with the `xfs` filesystem.

### Solution
You can use `fdisk, mkswap` etc commands.
Follow below given steps:
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/vdb
```
Now enter below given responses:
```
Command (m for help): n
Select (default p):  <just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter>
Partition number (1-4, default 1): <just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter>
First sector (2048-2097151, default 2048):  <just-leave-it-default-and-press-enter>
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-2097151, default 2097151): +500M
Command (m for help): w
```

You can follow these same steps for the other partition.
Now format `/dev/vdb1` as swap:

```bash
sudo mkswap /dev/vdb1
sudo swapon /dev/vdb1
```

Edit `/etc/fstab` file and add an entry for swap partition:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/fstab
```

Add below given line in it:
```
/dev/vdb1 none swap defaults 0 0
```


Format `/dev/vdb2` as `xfs`:
```bash
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb2
```

## Storage Management - 2

### Task
In this exercise you'll need to create a Logical Volume Manager structure.

A. First, add these two physical volumes to LVM: `/dev/vdc` and `/dev/vdd`

B. Next, create a volume group called volume1 out of these two physical volumes, `/dev/vdc` and `/dev/vdd`

C. Finally, create a `logical volume` of `1GB` on the volume group `volume1`. The name of this `logical volume` should be `logic1`

### Solution
You can use commands like `pvcreate, vgcreate` and `lvcreate`.

Execute below given command to add the required two physical volumes to LVM: /:
```bash
sudo pvcreate /dev/vdc /dev/vdd
```
Execute below given command to create `volume1` volume group:

```bash
sudo vgcreate volume1 /dev/vdc /dev/vdd
```


Execute below given command to create a logical volume of `1GB` on the volume group `volume1`:
```bash
sudo lvcreate --size 1G --name logic1 volume1
```

## Operating Systems - 1

### Task
Send the `SIGHUP` signal to the `httpd` process.

### Solution
You can do this using `kill` command.
Identify the PID of `httpd`:
```bash
sudo systemctl status httpd
```

Look for the `Main PID`, if main `PID` is `1234` then execute below command:
`kill <signal> <PID/job number>`
- `SIGINT` (2): Interrupt (Ctrl+C)
- `SIGTERM` (15): Terminate (polite request to stop)
- `SIGKILL` (9): Kill (forceful termination)
```bash
sudo kill -SIGHUP 1234
```

## User and Group Management - 1

### Task
In this exercise you'll deal with advanced file permissions or attributes.

A. First, in your home directory you will find a file called `bobandjane`. Currently this file can only be `read by bob`.  
Add a new `ACL` permission so that `jane` can also read this.   
Jane should `not` have `write` or execute permissions, but only the read permission.

B. Next, in your `home` directory you will find a file named `frozenfile`.   
This currently has the `immutable` attribute set on it. Remove the immutable attribute from this file

### Solution
You need to use setfacl command with appropriate options.
Add a new ACL permission for user jane
```bash
sudo setfacl --modify user:jane:r bobandjane
```

`Remove` the `immutable` attribute from `frozenfile` file:
```bash
sudo chattr -i frozenfile
```

## Network Configuration - 1

### Task
SSH in to node01 using user bob and password caleston123

A. Add an extra DNS resolver (nameserver) on this system: `8.8.8.8`


B. Add a static host so that the host called database resolves to this IP address: 10.0.0.12


C. Find out the IP address of eth1 interface on node01 and add a temporary static route so that network traffic going to 192.168.5.0/24 is routed via the IP address you find.


Don't forget to log out from node01 when you're done with this exercise.
### Solution
Solution
SSH into node01 using given credentials:


ssh node01



Add a new nameserver:


sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf



Add nameserver 8.8.8.8 line at the end of the file:


Add static host database:


sudo vi /etc/hosts



Add 10.0.0.12 database line at the end of the file:


Find out the IP address of eth1 interface using ip a command and add a static route (let's say IP address is 10.5.2.2):


sudo ip route add 192.168.5.0/24 via 10.5.2.2
